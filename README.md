Hi, we are Group 34 from the 2023-24 Term 1 DDA4210 (Advanced Machine Learning) course.

This repository contains our final project, which focuses on detecting fake face images and videos using a two-stream CNN architecture.

We incorporated a Gram Block to capture global texture information and a channel-wise attention module to enhance cross-method detection capabilities. Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++ dataset demonstrate that our model achieves better convergence and cross-dataset generalizability compared to traditional methods. However, this sometimes comes at the cost of within-method accuracy. Despite certain limitations, such as limited training data and inaccuracies in data labeling, our model shows significant potential for broader application in various AI-based face forgery detection techniques.
