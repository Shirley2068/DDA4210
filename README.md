Hi we are Group 34 of the 2023-24 Term 1 DDA4210(Advanced Machine Learning).

This is our final project, focusing on fake face image and video detection using CNN two-stream architecture.

We integrated a Gram Block for global texture information and a channel-wise attention module, enhancing cross-method detection capabilities. Experiments conducted using the FaceForensics++ database show that our model outperforms traditional methods in terms of convergence and cross-dataset generalizability, though it is sometimes at the expense of within-method accuracy. Despite some limitations, such as insufficient training data and inaccuracies in data labeling, our model highlights the potential for broader application on various AI face forgery techniques.
